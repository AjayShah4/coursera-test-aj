                        <p>
                            Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.[1] Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.
                            Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.[2]
                            The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.
                            Raw chicken may contain Salmonella. The safe minimum cooking temperature recommended by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services is 165 °F (74 °C) to prevent foodborne illness because of bacteria and parasites.[31] However, in Japan raw chicken is sometimes consumed in a dish called torisashi, which is sliced raw chicken served in sashimi style. Another preparation is toriwasa which is lightly seared on the outsides while the inside remains raw.[32]
                            Chicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads, traditionally grilled or by using electric grill, breaded and deep-fried, or used in various curries. There is significant variation in cooking methods amongst cultures. Historically common methods include roasting, baking, broasting, and frying. Western cuisine frequently has chicken prepared by deep frying for fast foods such as fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken lollipops or Buffalo wings. They are also often grilled for salads or tacos.

                        <p>
                            There’s a reason beef has a regular place in our weekly meal plans. Several reasons, actually. Beef is an incredibly versatile and (depending on how you shop) affordable option that can be cooked into many different types of dinners: We all know ground beef can be easily turned into dozens of recipes, including burgers or meatloaf, stir-fries, and casseroles. If a meaty steak is what you’re after, it’s surprisingly fast to cook up on the stovetop. And large, tough cuts of beef, like a top round or chuck roast, are ideal for slow roasts and stews (preferably in the slow cooker or Instant Pot).
                            Whatever you have on hand and whether you’re budgeting money or time, there’s something here for everybody.
                            Garlic Butter Steak Bites
                            Garlic-butter steak bites are everything you love about a steakhouse steak, with none of the work. Instead of cooking a whole steak, pieces of New York strip steak get cooked in a gorgeous garlic butter that’s built in the same pan the steak is cooked in. Pretty ingenious, right? 
                            Instant Pot Beef Stew
                            When cubes of beef, sweet carrots, and potatoes cook slowly together in a savory sauce, the resulting stew makes you want to grab a hunk of crusty bread and dig in. And thanks to your Instant Pot, the whole thing comes together in about an hour.
                            Sirloin Steak Sandwiches
                            This is one of the best beef recipes I made this year. It stretches a pound of sirloin into hearty sandwiches topped with tangy pickled onions, Dijonnaise, and greens, to feed the whole table.
                            Perfect Stovetop Steak
                            Steak dinner always feels like a luxury, but what really makes it so great is that with no more than 15 minutes of hands-on cooking, it’s totally doable any night of the week.
                            Classic Beef Pot Roast
                            Get out your Dutch oven and keep this recipe close by. It is the ultimate cozy, comforting dinner, with tender pieces of beef, rich gravy, and melt-in-your-mouth carrots, potatoes, and onions.
                            Weeknight Cabbage Rolls
                            To make this classic more weeknight-friendly, these ground meat and rice cabbage rolls are cooked on the stovetop in just one skillet, from start to finish.

                        <h3 class="text-center">Sushi</h3>
                        <p>
                            Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling;[3] the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[4] This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour";[5] the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[6] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.[7]
                            Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi"
                            Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.
                            It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori. The particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku.[7] The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.[8][9]
                            The earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the Oxford English Dictionary is in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring".[10][11] There is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's Japanese-English dictionary from 1873,[12] and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries.
